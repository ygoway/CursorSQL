# CursorSQL

1. Design database for an airport.

The database should contain the following information:

- Information about planes (model, serial number, seats)

- Information about pilots (name, age, models of planes that he can fly)

Provide SQL script to create the database.



For example:

We have 2 Boeing 747 (467 seats) and 5 Airbus A320 (186 seats)

We have 2 pilots that can fly both Boeing 747 and Airbus A320, 1 pilot can fly Boeing 747, and 5 pilots can fly Airbus A320.

So we can use 1 Boeing 747 (2 pilots required) and 3 Airbus A320 (2 pilots for each). Total seats: 467 + (3 * 186) = 1025
